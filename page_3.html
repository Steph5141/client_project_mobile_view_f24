            <p>At the University of Michigan we understand that college is expensive, that is way we have created the Maize & Blue cupboard. The Maize & Blue Cupboard acts as a food pantry for students who are having any type of food insecurity.</p>

        <div>
            <p><br>The Maize & Blue cupboard prioritizes privacy for students who might not want others to know they are using it You set up an appointment online and go in during the time you selected. The only information they need is a valid UofM ID to ensure that this is only for students. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><br>The Maize & Blue cupboard is set up like a grocery store, you sign up for a 15 minute appointment slot and you are welcome to browse the selections. You can always go just to see what they have and leave with as much or as little as they need. Some high demand items do have a limit associated with them.</p>
