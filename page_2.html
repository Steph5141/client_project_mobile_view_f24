            <p>At the University of Michigan we understand that it can be harder for first-generation students to know where to find information. We know that as a new student to the University it can be challenging to feel like you belong. That is why we have put together some of the most important information here to help you in your academic and personal journey here at the University of Michigan. </p>

            <p><br>The first thing to know is that you are considered a first-generation student if your parents or guardians have not completed a 4-year degree from a University. If other people in your life have a 4-year degree you are still considered a first-generation student.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><br>The University of Michigan is proud to host the First-Gen Gateway, a hub of faculty to help you find resources. The First-Gen Gateway is housed in the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives. This space can be used as a place to study, to lounge, to connect with resources available to first-gen students, and as a place to get support.</p>
